From day one we’ve always tied templates to a CLI. The main reason for this is that we want to keep sandboxes simple, you shouldn’t need to do any configuration to get started. I didn’t want to create a ‘Vanilla’ template because there was no way to create ‘vanilla’ web projects without configuration, until recently.

We now have support for the Parcel template, based on the [Parcel bundler](https://parceljs.org).
